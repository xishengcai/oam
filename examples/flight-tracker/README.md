# Flight Tracker

This is an example microservices application with a Javascript Web UI, a PostgreSQL database, and a series of API microservices. The idea is that various app developers would create Components for their corresponding apps. The overall config will add traits and allow the app to be fully deployed

## Apply Definition

For this demo, it is necessary to create a `WorkloadDefinition` for the `ContainerizedWorkload` and `PostgreSQLInstance` workload types, and a `TraitDefinition` for the `ManualScalerTrait` type.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f definitions/
workloaddefinition.core.oam.dev/containerizedworkloads.core.oam.dev created
traitdefinition.core.oam.dev/manualscalertraits.core.oam.dev created
```

## Install Component

Register the `Components`.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f components/
component.core.oam.dev/data-api created
component.core.oam.dev/tracker-postgres-db created
component.core.oam.dev/flights-api created
component.core.oam.dev/quakes-api created
component.core.oam.dev/service-tracker-ui created
component.core.oam.dev/weather-api created
```

## Run ApplicationConfiguration

Install the `ApplicationConfiguration`.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f tracker-app-config.yaml
secret/dbuser created
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/service-tracker created
```

## Result

Visit your browser, and open `http://{your-ingress-address}/web-ui` for the Service Tracker website. Refresh the data on the dashboard for each of the microservices.
